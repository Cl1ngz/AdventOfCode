# Advent of Code 2015

Welcome to my solutions for the **Advent of Code 2015** challenges!  
Each day's challenge has been solved in **Rust**, with future implementations planned in **Java** and **C**.

### Usage

To view each solution in detail, click on the respective day below. Each link will take you to the day's README file, where you can find explanations, code, and any additional notes about the solution.

### Project Structure

Each day's solution folder (`Day01`, `Day02`, etc.) contains:

- **README.md**: Detailed explanation and approach for the day's challenge.
- **Solution Code**: Code written in Rust, with Java and C versions to come.

### Future Plans

I plan to add:

- **Java and C Implementations** for each day.
