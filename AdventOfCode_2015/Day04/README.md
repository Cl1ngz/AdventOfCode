# Challenge Description The Ideal Stocking Stuffer

## Part 1

Santa needs help mining some AdventCoins (very similar to bitcoins) to use as gifts for all the economically forward-thinking little girls and boys.

To do this, he needs to find MD5 hashes which, in hexadecimal, start with at least five zeroes. The input to the MD5 hash is some secret key (your puzzle input, given below) followed by a number in decimal. To mine AdventCoins, you must find Santa the lowest positive number (no leading zeroes: 1, 2, 3, ...) that produces such a hash.

For example:

- If your secret key is abcdef, the answer is 609043, because the MD5 hash of abcdef609043 starts with five zeroes (000001dbbfa...), and it is the lowest such number to do so.
- If your secret key is pqrstuv, the lowest number it combines with to make an MD5 hash starting with five zeroes is 1048970; that is, the MD5 hash of pqrstuv1048970 looks like 000006136ef....

## Part 2

Now find one that starts with six zeroes.

## Solution

You can find the Rust and Java solution for each part of this challenge:

- **Part 1 Solution in rust**: [`part1.rs`](rust/src/bin/part1.rs)
- **Part 2 Solution in rust**: [`part2.rs`](rust/src/bin/part2.rs)

- **Java Part 1**: [`Part1.java`](java/Part1.java)
- **Java Part 2**: [`Part2.java`](java/Part2.java)

## Prerequisites

To run these solutions, ensure you have Rust installed. You can install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

To run the Java solutions, make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. You can download it from [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/) or use a JDK from your systemâ€™s package manager.

## How to Run

Once Rust is installed, you can run the solutions with the following commands:

```bash
cd rust
cargo run --bin part1
# or
cargo run --bin part2
```

```bash
cd java
# For Day X Part 1
javac DayX/Part1.java
java DayX.Part1
# For Day X Part 2
javac DayX/Part2.java
java DayX.Part2
```
