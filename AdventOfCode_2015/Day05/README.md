# Challenge Description Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This?

## Part 1

Santa needs help figuring out which strings in his text file are naughty or nice.

A nice string is one with all of the following properties:

- It contains at least three vowels (aeiou only), like aei, xazegov, or aeiouaeiouaeiou.
- It contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row, like xx, abcdde (dd), or aabbccdd (aa, bb, cc, or dd).
- It does not contain the strings ab, cd, pq, or xy, even if they are part of one of the other requirements.

For example:

- ugknbfddgicrmopn is nice because it has at least three vowels (u...i...o...), a double letter (...dd...), and none of the disallowed substrings.
- aaa is nice because it has at least three vowels and a double letter, even though the letters used by different rules overlap.
- jchzalrnumimnmhp is naughty because it has no double letter.
- haegwjzuvuyypxyu is naughty because it contains the string xy.
- dvszwmarrgswjxmb is naughty because it contains only one vowel.

How many strings are nice?

## Part 2

Realizing the error of his ways, Santa has switched to a better model of determining whether a string is naughty or nice. None of the old rules apply, as they are all clearly ridiculous.

Now, a nice string is one with all of the following properties:

- It contains a pair of any two letters that appears at least twice in the string without overlapping, like xyxy (xy) or aabcdefgaa (aa), but not like aaa (aa, but it overlaps).
- It contains at least one letter which repeats with exactly one letter between them, like xyx, abcdefeghi (efe), or even aaa.

For example:

- qjhvhtzxzqqjkmpb is nice because is has a pair that appears twice (qj) and a letter that repeats with exactly one letter between them (zxz).
- xxyxx is nice because it has a pair that appears twice and a letter that repeats with one between, even though the letters used by each rule overlap.
- uurcxstgmygtbstg is naughty because it has a pair (tg) but no repeat with a single letter between them.
- ieodomkazucvgmuy is naughty because it has a repeating letter with one between (odo), but no pair that appears twice.

How many strings are nice under these new rules?

## Prerequisites

To run these solutions, ensure you have Rust installed. You can install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

To run the Java solutions, make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. You can download it from [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/) or use a JDK from your systemâ€™s package manager.

## How to Run

Once Rust is installed, you can run the solutions with the following commands:

```bash
cd rust
cargo run --bin part1
# or
cargo run --bin part2
```

```bash
cd java
# For Day X Part 1
javac DayX/Part1.java
java DayX.Part1
# For Day X Part 2
javac DayX/Part2.java
java DayX.Part2
```
