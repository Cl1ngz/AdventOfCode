# Challenge Description Some Assembly Required

## Part 1

This year, Santa brought little Bobby Tables a set of wires and bitwise logic gates! Unfortunately, little Bobby is a little under the recommended age range, and he needs help assembling the circuit.

Each wire has an identifier (some lowercase letters) and can carry a 16-bit signal (a number from 0 to 65535). A signal is provided to each wire by a gate, another wire, or some specific value. Each wire can only get a signal from one source, but can provide its signal to multiple destinations. A gate provides no signal until all of its inputs have a signal.

The included instructions booklet describes how to connect the parts together: x AND y -> z means to connect wires x and y to an AND gate, and then connect its output to wire z.

For example:

    123 -> x means that the signal 123 is provided to wire x.
    x AND y -> z means that the bitwise AND of wire x and wire y is provided to wire z.
    p LSHIFT 2 -> q means that the value from wire p is left-shifted by 2 and then provided to wire q.
    NOT e -> f means that the bitwise complement of the value from wire e is provided to wire f.

Other possible gates include OR (bitwise OR) and RSHIFT (right-shift). If, for some reason, you'd like to emulate the circuit instead, almost all programming languages (for example, C, JavaScript, or Python) provide operators for these gates.

For example, here is a simple circuit:

```bash
123 -> x
456 -> y
x AND y -> d
x OR y -> e
x LSHIFT 2 -> f
y RSHIFT 2 -> g
NOT x -> h
NOT y -> i
```

After it is run, these are the signals on the wires:

```bash
d: 72
e: 507
f: 492
g: 114
h: 65412
i: 65079
x: 123
y: 456
```

In little Bobby's kit's instructions booklet (provided as your puzzle input), what signal is ultimately provided to wire a?

## Part 2

## Solution

You can find the Rust and Java solution for each part of this challenge:

- **Part 1 Solution in rust**: [`part1.rs`](rust/src/bin/part1.rs)
- **Part 2 Solution in rust**: [`part2.rs`](rust/src/bin/part2.rs)

- **Java Part 1**: [`Part1.java`](java/Part1.java)
- **Java Part 2**: [`Part2.java`](java/Part2.java)

## Prerequisites

To run these solutions, ensure you have Rust installed. You can install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

To run the Java solutions, make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. You can download it from [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/) or use a JDK from your system’s package manager.

## How to Run

Once Rust is installed, you can run the solutions with the following commands:

```bash
cd rust
cargo run --bin part1
# or
cargo run --bin part2
```

```bash
cd java
# For Day X Part 1
javac DayX/Part1.java
java DayX.Part1
# For Day X Part 2
javac DayX/Part2.java
java DayX.Part2
```
